:video_game: Game manager for HungerStruck.


# Open Source Release Notes

This is the source code for the former HungerStruck game plugin. It will likely be difficult to successfuly run the plugin in its current state, but feel free to explore the code or use it. You can reach out to us through the issue tracker if you have any questions, but note that it is unlikely you will receive support on launching it. 

## Compiling

To compile, you need Strukkit 1.8 in your local repository.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:kblanks/Strukkit && cd Strukkit
$ ./build.sh
```
